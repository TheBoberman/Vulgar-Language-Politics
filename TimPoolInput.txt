i kept telling these libs that importing religious conservatives would result in conservative public rulings

Now they are losing it

i know what will teach these pro-lifers a lesson   

If youre pro-life youre NOT allowed to get an abortion
 
and if youre pro choice we will help you get an abortion

ha, that will teach those pro lifers!

the issue is culture and community

we dont have shared morality, we arent even a community anymore so no one cares about anyone else

This is why there is crime and its why there are cops mistreating people

We need cultural reform

man

imagine being so stupid you still fall for this shit

i think regular people are finally realizing the media just lies about everything

Moribundly obese

AOC is evil

They tried as hard as possible to claim trump was lying

5 years ago I was worried that rising tribalism and political street fights could be a precursor to civil war

We are now at the "President has Arrested his political rival" phase

Libs and leftists will make any and every argument as to why its justified but of course that doesnt matter

Every dictator gives a reason why they arrest their rivals (see Putin for instance)

We are past the "weaponization of government against political faction point"

That happened a long time ago. We are at the top now.

It began with tribalism for which i was told would never escalate because the security state would not allow it

Of course the bifurcation of our society would and did reach the highest levels of government as I had warned

But it wasnt an original idea

I had just read security assessments, history, and famously statements from universities

"...the United States faces a sixty-per-cent chance of civil war over the next ten to fifteen years. Other expertsâ€™ predictions ranged from five per cent to ninety-five per cent. The sobering consensus was thirty-five per cent. And that was five months before Charlottesville."

The left can justify Trump's arrest but that means nothing at the macro level

Those ideologically opposed to the left will not accept those arguments or justifications

The left will say the right is fascist
The right will say the left is fascist

Whoever wins will be correct

activism vs honesty

The activist is happy when information is withheld because it can negatively impact their ideological aims

an honest person just wants to know whats really happening or what is being said

How can you be a news outlet and not run a statement from the GOP frontrunner immediately after a historical indictment?

forgive me if i dont believe the massive corporation when they deny something workers were noticing

The workers are also ideologically motivated so have more reason to tell the truth in the matter and Starbucks fear of financial harm explain why they'd deny

they mad
the piece has been updated with a denial by starbucks

Thank you @POTUS
 for condemning the trans activists who engaged in lewd behavior.

This is the way

THIS IS GENOCIDE

The New Republic is evil

The bomb threats came from LGBTQ activists not from the right

wow Biden's White House condemned trans activists and banned them

Talk about the left losing the culture war

1. drones can't occupy city streets
2. in civil war, military defects as well, its not all militia
3. killing large groups of civilians can result in blowback which generates partisan support against government (see Syria)

this chic is clearly having a psychotic break

running around screaming the n word and hitting random people

The more Desantis fans double down on defending the use of Deepfakes to smear a political opponent the more I will bring it up

We have talked about the danger of using AI in politics well before @RonDeSantis
 ran this ad and I'm not going to back down

honest question

do women wear big earrings in sporting events like that?

Ol' deepfake desantis over here posting deepfakes

If the argument is that @RonDeSantis
 is justified in lying to win political power because other people lie too

Then he deserves to lose and I hope he does

When will @GovRonDeSantis
 delete this and apologize?

So @BBC
 lying again?

Lol, unsurprising

dont do it brian

working out boosts testosterone and it will turn you conservative

and people get their news from these people

spoiler: Chernobyl is in Ukraine

its a good thing no one intervened to help her

the rapist might have died

Does this flag divide the US?

Yes

The president knows this flag is not supported by most Americans but dos not care

Flying a flag of ideology over the flag of country

Liberals have gun envy, that's why they want to take our guns away

They brag that they broke the law and got away with it

i gotta shitpost more on here

getting ratio'd = fast cash

ok here goes

leftists are grooming kids

i feel bad for @TheBabylonBee
 sometimes

they just cant compete with reality

After a psychotic episode punching herself in the face over and over Page says she heard a voice telling her she was trans.

Within weeks she scheduled the appointment 

Under any other circumstances this would be a 5150, not "affirmation"

Cop is in the right

Never forget activists lie to generate press

Leftists have no moral framework

If a dude says "leave kids alone" so you fire him, I think its reasonable to say COD is run by pedophiles

Call Of Groomers

Biden is cheating the 2024 election by indicting Trump

holy fuck man

TRUMP REPORTS HE HAS BEEN INDICTED

it makes no sense for Hannah to be CEO other than Veritas is collapsing and is in desperate need for a name to insert

I hereby disavow Trump for posting a video of the Devil and Hitler in a chatroom making fun of Desantis

Many Desantis supporters thought it was real and it was wrong for Trump to post it

Fake images posted by the Desantis campaign used to smear Trump

top left, bottom middle, bottom right

"Real Life Trump"

Complete and utter Biden level scumbaggery
